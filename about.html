                                こんにちは, my name is Dreckiez. I'm an IT major at Ho Chi Minh University of Science (HCMUS), striving to make a living through coding. Though I'm always trying to learn more about coding and currently interested in Software Engineer and Computer Vision, I often struggle with staying motivated and focusing on what to learn next. At times, it feels like I hit a wall, unsure of which direction to go.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I've tried website development, but found myself stumbling because I'm not particularly creative and sensitive to colors, which made designing appealing websites difficult. I faced a similar issue when I tried diving into game development — while I loved the idea, I couldn't come up with any unique or exciting game concepts. The lack of inspiration left me feeling stuck, questioning whether I was cut out for this field.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Despite these setbacks, I'm determined to keep pushing forward. That's why I decided to create this website — not only as a way to teach myself about web development but also as a platform to share my stories and experiences with you all. Plus, it adds a nice touch to my resume!

                                The style and theme of this website were heavily influenced by the <a href="https://blowfish.page/" target="_blank">Blowfish</a> theme by <a href="https://n9o.xyz/" target="_blank">Nuno Coração</a>, while the Markdown-like blog layout was inspired by <a href="https://vinhphamthanh.dev/" target="_blank">@vinhphamthanh</a> - a senpai from my school.
                            </p>

                                While working on this website, I researched Hugo — a static site generator that efficiently converts Markdown content into a fully structured website with templates and layouts. However, since I was still new to JavaScript and CSS, I felt it was too complex for my needs. So, I decided to stick with the traditional approach: manually creating an HTML file for each blog post (# `-_ゝ-)
