                                こんにちは, my name is Dreckiez. I'm a Software Engineering major at Ho Chi Minh University of Science (HCMUS) working to build a career in coding. I'm especially interested in DevOps and front-end development, and I'd like to learn more about the two as I continue. I find myself confused at times wondering how to remain motivated and what to learn next. There are times when I feel like I have hit a dead end and I do not know what to do next.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I've tried web development, but kept stalling as I'm not very creative and color-sensitive, and it was difficult to create handsome-looking websites. I also had this issue when I tried dabbling in game development — even though I was enthusiastic about the venture, I couldn't come up with any new or interesting game concepts. Lack of ability to be inspired left me clueless, wondering if I was truly cut out for this profession.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In spite of these shortcomings, I'm not giving up. That's why I've gone ahead and created this website — not only to teach myself web development, but also as a way of sharing my experiences and anecdotes with you guys. Plus, it adds a nice touch to my resume!

                                This website's theme and style were greatly inspired by <a href="https://n9o.xyz/" target="_blank">Nuno Coração's</a> <a href="https://blowfish.page/" target="_blank">Blowfish theme</a>, whereas the blog layout in Markdown style was inspired by <a href="https://vinhphamthanh.dev/" target="_blank">@vinhphamthanh</a> - my senpai from my school.

                                While making this website, I researched Hugo — a static site generator that basically takes Markdown content and converts it into a complete website with layouts and templates. But since I was still learning JavaScript and CSS, I found it too complicated to use. I therefore resorted to the ancient method: hand-crafting an HTML file for every blog post (# `-_ゝ-)
