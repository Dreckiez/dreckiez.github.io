    "content": "This is a mini project for my Programming Techniques subject. The project's purpose was to test my understandings and knowledge about 2D pointer and Linked List as well as my programming skills.<br>This project was created based on the Raylib library. I chose it because it seems like a modern and easy-to-use library for videogames programming with many handy functions for visualization."
