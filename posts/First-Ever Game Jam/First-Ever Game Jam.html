                                Some time ago, I participated in a new experience I had never previously had — my first-ever game jam. Having just 36 hours to generate ideas, design, and completely develop a game, I knew it was going to be an experience to remember. As an individual who has previously struggled to come up with ideas for a game, I was relieved but nervous about the outcome. Would my team and I manage to pull something together within hours? Or would we crash and burn under the pressure? Either way, I was happy to dive in, learn as much as I can, and push myself to the limit.

                                We arrived early at the venue, not just to secure a good spot but to obtain the limited Game Jam t-shirts and some other goodies. We also stopped by a nearby Family Mart for an early dinner so we'd have enough energy to spend on thinking — and, of course, fighting — when the jam proper began. The members of the staff were extremely nice and humorous, creating a great initial experience of meeting individuals from the gaming industry or who had their hearts in it.

                                The waiting area was not a letdown. The entire room was carpeted and had several ACs running to keep it cool. There were two tables laden with instant noodles, snacks, and energy drinks — all we needed to stay charged. We sat down, got comfortable, and waited for the much-awaited theme reveal.

                                The peak of glory finally came—the theme reveal. The theme for the current year was <b>"Bubble"</b>. I thought it was a very difficult theme to deal with, but once we finally discovered a place to jam, our group immediately started throwing ideas around. One of my group members had an idea that took hold: a <b><i>stock market simulator game</i></b> based on the concept of an <b><i>economic bubble</i></b>.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Initially, our game concept was players buying and selling stocks, then selling them to earn the highest profit, their actions influencing the market and in turn other players' choices too. It showed promise, but due to the intricacies of implementing multiplayer, the time constraint of the jam, and our inexperience at game development, we toned it down into a <b>solo experience</b> instead.
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    <b><u>First Day:</u></b>
                                    <p>
                                        I also had to design background music and sound effects for the game. Knowing that I could use something from Itch.io based on my experience with the Pikachu game project, I headed there and had a listen to some bundles of sound and music. I made sure to listen attentively to each and only select the very best that would fit our game.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Then I went through proofing information for our in-game news feed, which provided subtle hints about whether the market would go up or down. I remember falling asleep several times doing it—it wasn't my first all-nighter, but it had been a while since I last had one. By 4:00 AM, tiredness had taken its toll on me, and I eventually succumbed to a short nap. Two hours later, I awoke and continued tweaking the news data while my teammates prepared for school.

                                    <p>
                                        Having finished with the data, I was still exhausted from my 2-hour slumber and, since my teammates had already gone to school, I rested a bit. Waking up at approximately 8-9 AM, I got back to work, focusing on combining the music and sound effects with the game. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOhfqjmasi0">Brackeys's Godot Turtorial video</a> was incredibly helpful — I'd highly recommend it if you're looking to learn Godot.

                                    <p>
                                        Fast forward to the evening, our team gathered to code the game a bit more. UI integration was my job and my friends did the candlestick charts and news system. Seven hours of focused yet relaxing coding passed before I could get all the UI into the game at 3:00 AM.

                                        However, I had to deal with some of those pesky global variable problems, which nearly sent me mad. After some experimentation and trial, we managed to get it working by sending signals back and forth. With that sorted out, there was only playtesting and debugging remaining.

                                Looking back, my very first game jam was an experience that was a rollercoaster. From idea to late nights debugging code, every moment was a mix of excitement, frustration, and learning. With our inexperience and all the issues we faced, we managed to turn our game into reality within the 36-hour period. Above all, I got to work with an amazing team, improve my skills, and better appreciate game development.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                This experience laid the groundwork for my game development experiment, a good jumping off point to continue from. With this complete circle of design, code, debug, and polish behind me now, I'm more confident in my ability to create another new game sometime in the near future. I have no idea when my next game jam will strike again, but one thing's for sure — I'll be back, and more prepared, and ready to create something even better.
