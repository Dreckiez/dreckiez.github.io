    "content": "Some time ago, I participated in a new experience I had never previously had â€” my first-ever game jam. Having just 36 hours to generate ideas, design, and completely develop a game, I knew it was going to be an experience to remember. As an individual who has previously struggled to come up with ideas for a game, I was relieved but nervous about the outcome. Would my team and I manage to pull something together within hours? Or would we crash and burn under the pressure?"
