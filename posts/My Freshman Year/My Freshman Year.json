I've created this website and these (upcoming) blogs for a single purpose: honing my programming skills, knowledge and sharing my experiences as an IT student with a bit of C++ background from high school. <br> So, a little bit about me and how I got into HCMUS. I've always been pretty good at Physics, Math, English, and Informatics (where I learned about Pascal and C++), but I was never really passionate about any of them. That remained the case until grade 12, when I needed to decide on my major. At first, I considered majoring in English Language, as I had already won some English prizes and scored 7.5 on my IELTS. But then I realized I should pursue IT, since it's a high-paying and trending field."
